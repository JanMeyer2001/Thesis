\chapter{Conclusion} \label{Ch:Conclusion}
After finding optimal model parameters for \emph{Fourier-Net}, \emph{Fourier-Net+} and \emph{4xFourier-Net+}, their registration performance was compared to \emph{NiftyReg} and \emph{VoxelMorph} on the \emph{ACDC} dataset. As expected, the three networks performed very well for the different reduction factor present in the dataset with \emph{Fourier-Net} generally performing best, though \emph{4xFourier-Net+} had similar results while being more efficient.\\
Trying to further optimize the performance, different loss functions e.g. utilizing k-space information or the contrastive InfoNCE loss were tested, though non of these were able to provide a better performance.\\
Lastly, the networks were used in an motion-compensated reconstruction pipeline on \emph{CMRxRecon} data that was further motion-corrupted.
